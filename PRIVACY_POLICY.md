**Last Updated: November 12, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to Matooke Log ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Matooke Log handles your data when you use our mobile and web application.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Don't Collect

Matooke Log is designed as a **completely offline application**. We want to make it clear that:

- ✅ **No personal information is collected** from you
- ✅ **No data is transmitted** to our servers or any third-party servers
- ✅ **No analytics or tracking** is performed
- ✅ **No user accounts** are required or created
- ✅ **No internet connection** is required for the app to function
- ✅ **No advertising IDs** or device identifiers are collected
- ✅ **No location data** is accessed or stored

### What Data is Stored Locally

All data you enter into Matooke Log is stored **exclusively on your device**:

- **Farming Records**: Information about crops you plant, harvest, and sell
  - Crop names
  - Dates
  - Quantities
  - Optional notes
- **App Preferences**: Your app settings and preferences

This data is stored using:
- **Mobile/Desktop**: SQLite database stored in your device's local storage
- **Web**: Browser's SharedPreferences/LocalStorage

### Data Ownership

You retain full ownership and control of all data entered into Matooke Log. Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- You can delete the app at any time to remove all data
- You can clear app data through your device settings
- You can export your data using the CSV export feature

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security

Your data is protected by:
- Your device's operating system security features
- Your device's lock screen and authentication
- Standard mobile/web application sandboxing

### No External Transmission

Since Matooke Log operates entirely offline:
- Your data never leaves your device
- There is no risk of data breaches from server hacks
- No third parties have access to your farming records

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data** because we do not collect any data. Your farming records remain private and accessible only to you on your device.

## Third-Party Services

Matooke Log does **not** integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

### Open Source Dependencies

The app uses the following open-source libraries, which operate locally on your device:
- Flutter framework
- SQLite database (mobile/desktop)
- SharedPreferences (web)
- FL Chart (for data visualization)
- Google Fonts (fonts are bundled with the app)

None of these libraries transmit your personal data to external servers.

## Children's Privacy

Matooke Log does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.

## Data Backup and Loss

### Your Responsibility

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **You are responsible** for backing up your data
- We recommend using the CSV export feature regularly to create backups
- Uninstalling the app or clearing app data will permanently delete your records
- Device loss, damage, or factory reset will result in data loss

### No Cloud Backup

Matooke Log does not provide cloud backup or sync features. Your data exists only on your device.
